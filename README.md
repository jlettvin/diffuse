# diffuse

This program is designed to show what happens to discrete charges
constrained within a sphere.
It confirms Gauss's law by brute force.

Charged particles finding equilibrium position on surface of sphere.
A strange observation is that, in the presence of noise,
with the exception of Euclidean solid vertex arrangements,
charges continue to perform rapid traversals to different locations
and charges adjacent to the path spiral to avoid the passing charge.

File output is in standard Wavefront .OBJ format
and can be displayed by any program capable of
displaying this format.
